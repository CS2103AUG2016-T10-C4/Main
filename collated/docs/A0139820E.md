Priority | As a ... | I want to ... | So that I can...
-------- | :------- | :--------- | :-----------
`* * *` | new user | see usage instructions | find out how to use the app
`* * *` | basic user | add an event with start and end time| know how long I need to spend on the event
`* * *` | basic user | add a deadline with date and time | decide what needs to be done soon
`* * *` | basic user | add a task with only description | record tasks that needs to be done some day
`* * *` | basic user | list all tasks that were added | can get a overview on all my tasks
`* * *` | basic user | find a specific task | refer to the task details quickly
`* * *` | basic user | edit a task | update the task details when I need to
`* * *` | basic user | delete a task | remove tasks that I no longer need to do
`* * *` | basic user | undo actions made | undo my mistakes quickly
`* * *` | basic user | be able to enter commands differently | have more flexibility in my commands
`* * *` | basic user | specify a folder as the data storage location | have more control on the where the data is stored
`* *` | intermediate user | add priority levels to my tasks | do more urgent tasks first
`* *` | intermediate user | clear all task that are completed | remove them at once instead individually
`* *` | intermediate user | add tags to my tasks | organize my tasks into different categories
`* *` | intermediate user | list all completed tasks | remove them if needed
`* *` | intermediate user | list all incomplete tasks | check on my progress
`* *` | intermediate user | see a list of commands I have added before | trace my action if needed
`* *` | intermediate user | redo an undone command | do not need to manually type out the changes if needed
`* *` | intermediate user | pin a tasks | keep important tasks at the top
`* *` | intermediate user | check time remaining | find out how much time remaining without manually calculating
`* *` | intermediate user | search for empty slots | I can find suitable slots to put in new tasks
`*` | advanced user | add weekly recurring tasks | do not need to add them individually
`*` | advanced user | sort my tasks in a specific order ( e.g. by priority, by date, by alphabetical) | easily find tasks in sequence
