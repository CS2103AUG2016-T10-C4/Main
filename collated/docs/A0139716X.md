## 9. Future Development	

These are several additions that can be made to **KeyboardWarrior**	 to further increase its usefulness and usability.

### **More Commands**

More commands can be added on to the current application. This allows for greater functionality to suit various users.

> Examples:
> * Search for empty slots.
> * Add recurring tasks.
> * Add tags to tasks. 

### **Integration With Other Scheduler Apps**

**KeyboardWarrior** currently does not integrate with any other scheduler apps (e.g. `Google Calender`). This added functionality would be useful to attract current users of the other scheduler apps.

### **Secure Data**

Data could be secured through encryption so that only users can only access their own data to ensure privacy.

## 1. About Our Product
<br>
KeyboardWarrior is a scheduler and task manager application that accepts short and intuitive commands to provide a quick and convenient way to manage tasks using only the keyboard.

It allows you to schedule, reschedule, update, and delete tasks with just a single command. You will no longer have to rely on your fallible memory to manage your schedule.

## 3. Features
<br>
To understand the following command formats, you can refer to these rules below:

<br>
> 1) Words that are within ** ** are commands.
> 
>     E.g. Format for adding Deadline: **add** TASK by DATE [TIME]
> 
> The word `**add**` here is the command that determines the action to be done.
> 
> 2) Words in UPPERCASE are the parameters.
>
>     E.g. Format for adding Deadline: **add** TASK by DATE [TIME]
> 
> The words `TASK`, `DATE` and `TIME` here are the parameters that represents the details of the Deadline item to be created. They should be replaced by what you want the details to be. For example, `DATE` should be replaced by a specific date of the Deadline.  
> 
> 3) Items in [square brackets] are optional.
> 
>     E.g. Format for adding Deadline: **add** TASK by DATE [TIME]
> 
> The `TIME` parameter in this case is optional. The command will still be valid even if no specific time for the `TIME` parameter is indicated.
> 
> 4) Items with ... after them can have multiple instances.
> 
>     E.g. Format for marking completed items: **complete** INDEXâ€¦
> 			
> The `...` means that the command can accept more than one `INDEX` parameter after the command word `complete`. For example, a valid command would be â€œcomplete INDEX1 INDEX2 INDEX3â€�, assuming INDEX1, INDEX2 and INDEX3 follow the proper conventions for `INDEX` parameters.
> 
> 5) Items within (parentheses) with `|` between them need to have at least one of them used as the parameter.
> 
>     E.g. Format for finding items: **find** (KEYWORD | @VENUE)
> 
> There needs to be either an input as the `KEYWORD` parameter or the `VENUE` parameter or two inputs for both. Valid commands would be â€œfind KEYWORDâ€�, â€œfind @VENUEâ€� or â€œfind KEYWORD @VENUEâ€�.
> 
> 6) The order of the format must be strictly adhered to.

<br>
#### 3.1.1. Viewing help 
<br>
Format: `**help**`

This will load the help window which will show all the available commands that can be used in **KeyboardWarrior**. It will help you learn about the commands if you are a new user or you can refer to a commandâ€™s exact function and format when needed.

```

<br>
#### 3.1.4. Add Event
<br>
Format: `**add** DATE [STARTTIME [to ENDTIME]] EVENT [@VENUE]`

This adds an Event to the schedule in **KeyboardWarrior**. An Event is an activity that occurs at a specific date or time.  You have the option to indicate either a time period which includes a starting and ending time or just a start time of the event. If there is no specific start time, just the day it occurs needs to be specified. The venue is also an optional parameter.

(Note: The start time needs to be indicated if an end time is indicated.) 

This is suitable for things you might have to attend at a particular time with specific end times, e.g. meetings, or without, e.g. birthday parties. It can also be used to record down an activity that you have not decided a start time for.

<br>
> Parameter usage:
> 
> **STARTTIME** and **ENDTIME**
> 
> The STARTTIME parameter represents the start time of the Event.
> 
> 
> The ENDTIME parameter represents the end time of the Event. It has to be preceded by 'to'.
> 
> Both the STARTTIME and ENDTIME parameters follows the same format as the TIME parameter specified in 3.1.3. Add Deadline Task.
> 
> **DATE**
> 
> The DATE parameter represents the day the Event is on.
> 
> The DATE parameter follows the same format as the DATE parameter specified in 3.1.3. Add Deadline Task.
> 
> **EVENT**
> 
> The EVENT parameter should be the name or a short description of the Event to be created.
> 
> **VENUE**
> 
> The VENUE parameter represents where the Event will be held.
> 
> The VENUE parameter should be the name of the venue of the Event. It has to be preceded by the @ symbol.

<br>
Examples: 

`**add** Fri 1410 to 1600 Group Meeting @I3 MR9`

> Creates a new Event with the time period as Friday, 2:10 p.m. to 4:00 p.m., the description as â€œGroup Meetingâ€� and the venue as â€œI3 MR9â€�.

<br>
#### 3.1.5. Find item
<br>
Format: `**find** (KEYWORD | @VENUE`

This allows you to find all items in **KeyboardWarrior** that contains the phrase or venue that is indicated.

It is important to note that the `KEYWORD` will also be searched in the venue details of the items. In addition, a combined search is also allowed, hence both parameters can be entered together, where the result returned would have the keyword in the itemâ€™s description and the `VENUE` parameter in the itemâ€™s venue. 

<br>
> Parameter usage:
> 
> **KEYWORD**
> 
> The KEYWORD parameter indicates the word to be searched for in the descriptions and venues of items on **KeyboardWarrior**.
> 
> **VENUE**
> 
> The VENUE parameter indicates the word to be searched only in the venues of items on **KeyboardWarrior**. It has to be preceded by the @ symbol.

<br>
Examples: 

`**complete** D1`

> Mark Deadline 1 as complete and delete it from the keep in viewfinder.
   
`**complete** T1 D2`

> Mark To-do 1 and Dealine 2 as complete and delete it from the keep in viewfinder.

<br>
#### 3.1.8. Delete Items from Calendar
<br>
Format: `**delete** INDEX`

This command will delete the item of the specified index from **KeyboardWarrior**. This action is irreversible. This may be used for tasks that were mistakenly added, tasks that no longer need to be completed or Events that have passed. You can delete To-dos, Deadlines and Events.

A list of items must be displayed before using this command.
It is possible to delete multiple items in a single command by entering more than one `INDEX`.

<br>
> Parameter Usage:
> 
> **INDEX**
> 
> The INDEX refers to the index number corresponding to the listed item shown on the calendar.
>
> The INDEX must be a letter followed by an integer or just an integer, <br>
> E.g. D2, 3, T2

<br>
Examples: 

`**delete** 4 5` 

> The events with index number 4 and 5 are removed from the list. 

<br>
#### 3.1.9. Exiting the program 
<br>
Format: `**exit**`  

This command exits the program, all your events and task inside your calendar will be saved.

<br>
### 3.2 Saving the data 
Calendar data in **KeyboardWarrior** are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data.

There is no need to save manually.
