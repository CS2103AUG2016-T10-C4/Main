## 10. Future Development	

These are several additions that can be made to **KeyboardWarrior**	 to further increase its usefulness and usability.

### **More Commands**

More commands can be added on to the current application. This allows for greater functionality to suit various users.

> Examples:
> * Search for empty slots.
> * Add recurring tasks.
> * Add tags to tasks. 

### **Integration With Other Scheduler Apps**

**KeyboardWarrior** currently does not integrate with any other scheduler apps (e.g. `Google Calender`). This added functionality would be useful to attract current users of the other scheduler apps.

### **Secure Data**

Data could be secured through encryption so that only users can only access their own data to ensure privacy.

## 3. Features
<br>
To understand the following command formats, you can refer to these rules below:

<br>
1) Words that are **bold** are *commands*.

> E.g. Format for adding Deadline: **`add`** `DEADLINE by DATE TIME`
> 
> The word **`add`** here is the command that determines the action to be done.

<br>
2) Words in UPPERCASE are the *parameters*.
     
> E.g. Format for adding Deadline: **`add`** `DEADLINE by DATE TIME`
> 
> The words `DEADLINE`, `DATE` and `TIME` here are the parameters that represents the details of the Deadline item to be created. They should be replaced by what you want the details to be. For example, `DATE` should be replaced by a specific date of the Deadline. 

<br> 
3) The order of the format must be strictly adhered to.

<br>
4) You can include *tags* in any of the tasks which you wish to add by using the `#` key. These tags can help you classify or identify unique tasks in your **KeyboardWarrior**. Tags are optional and are indicated in square brackets, i.e. [ ].

<br>
### 3.1.1. Viewing Help 
<br>
**Format:** **`help`** 

This will load the help window which will show all the available commands that can be used in **KeyboardWarrior**. 

It will help you learn about the commands if you are a new user or you can refer to a command's exact function and format when needed.

<br>
### 3.1.4. Add an Event
<br>
**Format:** **`add`** `EVENT from STARTDATE STARTTIME ENDDATE ENDTIME [#tag]`

This adds an Event to the schedule in **KeyboardWarrior**. An Event is an activity that occurs between a set of specific date and time.  

This is suitable for things you might have to attend at a particular time with specific end times, e.g. meetings, or without, e.g. birthday parties. 

<br>
**Parameter usage:**

`EVENT`
 
> The `EVENT` parameter should be the name or a short description of the Event to be created.

`STARTDATE` and `ENDDATE`
 
> The `STARTDATE` parameter represents the day the Event starts on.
> 
> The `ENDDATE` parameter represents the day the Event ends on.
>  
> Both the `STARTDATE` and `ENDDATE` parameters follows the same format as the `DATE` parameter specified in *3.1.3. Add Deadline Task*.
> 
> The `STARTDATE` parameter must be preceded by the word `from`.

`STARTTIME` and `ENDTIME`
 
> The `STARTTIME` parameter represents the start time of the Event. 
>  
> The `ENDTIME` parameter represents the end time of the Event. 
>  
> Both the `STARTTIME` and `ENDTIME` parameters follows the same format as the `TIME` parameter specified in *3.1.3. Add Deadline Task*.
 
<br>
**Examples:** 

**`add`** `Group meeting at I3 MR9 from 051016 1410 051016 1600`

> Creates a new Event 'Group meeting at I3 MR9' with the time period as 5 October 2016, 2:10 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. 

**`add`** `Basketball practice from 051016 1800 051016 2100 #basketball`

> Creates a new Event 'Basketball practice' with the time period as 5 October 2016, 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Also adds a #basketball tag to it.

<br>
### 3.1.5. Find an Item
<br>
**Format:** **`find`** `KEYWORD`

This allows you to find all Todos, Deadlines and Events in **KeyboardWarrior** that contains the phrase that is indicated.

<br>
**Parameter usage:**
 
`KEYWORD`

> The `KEYWORD` parameter indicates the word to be searched for in the descriptions of Todos, Deadlines and Events in **KeyboardWarrior**. It is important to note that the `KEYWORD` is not case-sensitive.
