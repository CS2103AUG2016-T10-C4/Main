## 9. Future Development	

These are several additions that can be made to **KeyboardWarrior**	 to further increase its usefulness and usability.

### **More Commands**

More commands can be added on to the current application. This allows for greater functionality to suit various users.

> Examples:
> * Search for empty slots.
> * Add recurring tasks.
> * Add tags to task. 

### **Integration With Other Scheduler Apps**

**KeyboardWarrior** currently does not integrate with any other scheduler apps (e.g. `Google Calender`). This added functionality would be useful to attract current users of the other scheduler apps.

### **Secure Data**

Data could be secured through encryption so that only users can only access their own data to ensure privacy.
