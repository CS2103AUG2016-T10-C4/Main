## 1. About

**KeyboardWarrior** is a scheduler and task manager application that accepts short and intuitive commands to provide a quick and convenient way to manage tasks using only the keyboard.

Our target audience are users who receives tasks that are to be scheduled at a later date. It allows the user to schedule, reschedule, update, and delete tasks with just a single command.

This guide describes the design and implementation of **KeyboardWarrior**. It will help you understand how **KeyboardWarrior** works and how you can further contribute to its development. We have organised this guide in a top-down manner so that you can understand the big picture before moving on to the more detailed sections.


## 2. Setting up

### 2.1. Before Using the Application

1. Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
	Download the latest version via this [**`link`**](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).
   > Having any Java 8 version is not enough. <br>
   This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.

2. Ensure you have Eclipse Integrated Development Environment (IDE).  <br>
    Download the latest version via this [**`link`**](http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/).
   
2. Download the latest `KeyboardWarrior.jar` from the [**`releases`**](../../../releases) tab.

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your **KeyboardWarrior**.

### 2.2 Import existing project into Eclipse

1. Fork this repository, and clone the fork to your computer.
2. Open Eclipse 
3. Click `File` > `Import`.
4. Click `General` > `Existing Projects into Workspace` > `Next`.
5. Click `Browse`, then locate the project's directory.
6. Click `Finish`.

### 2.3 Troubleshoot

**Problem: Eclipse reports compile errors after new commits are pulled from Git**

* _Reason_: Eclipse fails to recognise new files that appeared due to the Git pull. 
* _Solution_: you have to refresh the project in Eclipse:<br> 
  Right click on the project (in Eclipse package explorer), choose `Refresh`. Or press `F5` on your keyboard.

## 3. Architecture

<img src="images/Architecture.jpg" width="800"> <br>
> Figure 1: Architecture Class Diagram

Figure 1 shows the **_Architecture Diagram_** which gives the high-level design of **KeyboardWarrior**. You can refer to the section below to get a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has only one class called [**`Main`**](../src/ruby/keyboardwarrior/Main.java). It has 2 responsibilities:
1. At app launch: Initialises the components in the correct sequence, and connect them up with each other.
2. At shut down: Shuts down the components and invoke cleanup method where necessary.

[**`Common`**](#8-common-classes) represents a couple of classes used by multiple other components. These two classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `Utils` : This class is used by components to check if there are *Null* entires or if there are *Unique* elements.
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write visible messages.

The rest of **KeyboardWarrior** is made up of four main components:

* [**`UI`**](#4-ui-component) : The UI of tha App.
* [**`Logic`**](#5-logic-component) : The command executor.
* [**`Data`**](#6-data-component) : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#7-storage-component) : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given Figure 2) defines its API in the `Logic.java`
interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Logic.jpg" width="800"><br>
> Figure 2: Logic Component Class Diagram

The _Sequence Diagram_ in Figure 3 below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the
command `delete 1`.

<br>
<img src="images/DeleteTaskSequenceDiagram.jpg" width="800"><br>
> Figure 3: Delete Task Sequence Diagram


## 4. UI Component

<img src="images/UI.jpg" width="800"> <br>
> Figure 4: UI Component Class Diagram

**API** : [`GUI.java`](../src/ruby/keyboardwarrior/ui/GUI.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts `commandInput`, `TaskListView` and `outputConsole`. All these, including the `MainWindow`, is called by the `GUI` class.

The UI component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layout of [`MainWindow`](../src/ruby/keyboardwarrior/ui/MainWindow.java) is defined in the matching â€œ.fxmlâ€? file that is located in `keyboardwarrior/ui/` folder, i.e. [`mainwindow.fxml`](../src/ruby/keyboardwarrior/ui/mainwindow.fxml).

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Data` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Data` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.


## 5. Logic Component

<img src="images/Logic.jpg" width="800"> <br>
> Figure 5:  Logic Component Class Diagram

**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/ruby/keyboardwarrior/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command.
2. The `Parser` class returns a `Command` object which is executed by the `Logic`.
3. The command execution can affect the `Data` (e.g. adding a task) and/or raise events.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below, in Figure 6, is the *Sequence Diagram* for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call. 

<img src="images/LogicDeleteTaskSequenceDiagram.jpg" width="700"> <br>
> Figure 6: Delete Task Sequence Diagram within Logic Componentm


## 6. Data Component

<img src="images/Data.jpg" width="800"> <br>
> Figure 7: Data Component Class Diagram

**API** : [`Data.java`](../src/ruby/keyboardwarrior/data/TasksList.java)

The `Data`,

* stores the **KeyboardWarrior** data.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


## 7. Storage Component

<img src="images/Storage.jpg" width="800"> <br>
> Figure 8: Storage Component Class Diagram

**API** : [`StorageFile.java`](../src/ruby/keyboardwarrior/storage/StorageFile.java)

## 8. Common Classes

You can find all classes used by multiple components in the `keyboardwarrior.common` package.

## 9. Testing

You can find the tests in the `/src/test/java` folder.

**In Eclipse**:
> If you are not using a recent Eclipse version (i.e. _Neon_ or later), enable assertions in JUnit tests
  as described [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2522897/eclipse-junit-ea-vm-option).

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose
  `Run as` > `JUnit Test`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose
  to run as a JUnit test.
  
We have two types of tests:

1. **Logic Tests** - i.e `ruby.keyboardwarrior.logic.LogicTest`.
  
2. **Parser Tests** - i.e `ruby.keyboardwarrior.parser.ParserTest`.

  
 
#### Troubleshooting tests
 **Problem: Tests fail because NullPointException when AssertionError is expected**
 * Reason: Assertions are not enabled for `JUnit` tests. 
   This can happen if you are not using a recent Eclipse version (i.e. _Neon_ or later)
 * Solution: Enable assertions in `JUnit` tests as described 
   [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2522897/eclipse-junit-ea-vm-option). <br>
   Delete run configurations created when you ran tests earlier.

<br>
#### 3.1.2. Add a To-do task
<br>
Format: `**add** TASK`

This adds a To-do to the schedule in **KeyboardWarrior**. A To-do is a kind of task that needs to be done by no specific deadline. It only contains a description of the task. 

It is useful for things that you might want to do in the near future but do not have a strict deadline for completion, e.g. reading a book for leisure.

<br>
> Parameter usage:
> 
> **TASK**
> 
> The TASK parameter should be the name or a short description of the To-do to be created.	

<br>
Examples: 

`**add** buy chocolate milk`

> Creates a new To-do with the description Ã¢â‚¬Å“Buy ChocolateÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.

<br>
#### 3.1.3. Add a Deadline task
<br>
Format: `**add** TASK by DATE [TIME]`

This adds a Deadline to the schedule in **KeyboardWarrior**. A Deadline is a kind of task that has to be completed by a specific deadline. Hence the date of the deadline should be specified in the command in addition to its description. A specific time here is optional.

This is suitable for most work-related tasks as they are usually scheduled within a certain timeframe to meet clientsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ demands, e.g. proposal submissions. 

<br> 
> Parameter usage:
> 
> **TASK**
> 
> The TASK parameter should be the name or a short description of the Deadline to be created.
>  
> **DATE**
> 
> The DATE parameter represents the specific day of the deadline.
> 
> Acceptable formats:
> 
> > 1) DDMMYY format.
> > 
>     E.g. 160417 represents the date April 16, 2017.
> 
> > 2) DDMM format.
> > 
> The year would be automatically set as the current year.
> 
> >     E.g. 0302 represents the date February 03 of the current year. 
> 
> > 3) Today.
> >
> The deadline would be set as the current day.
> 
> >		E.g. today represents the current day.
> 
> > 4) Tomorrow.
> >
> The deadline would be set as the day after the current day.
> 
> >The following forms are accepted: tomorrow, tmr and tmrw.
> 
> >	    E.g. tmr represents the day after the current day.
> 
> > 5) A specific day spelt out in full.
> > 
> The resulting deadline would be the coming indicated day.
> 
> >If the day indicated is the same as the current day, the resulting deadline would be the same day next week.
> >
>     E.g. Sunday represents the coming Sunday.
> 
> > 6) A specific day in its accepted abbreviated form as shown below
> > 
		Sunday:		Sun
	 	Monday:	    Mon
	 	Tuesday:	Tu, Tue or Tues
	 	Wednesday:	Wed
	 	Thursday:	Th, Thu, Thur or Thurs
	 	Friday:		Fri
	 	Saturday:	Sat
> 	
>> 	The resulting deadline would be the coming indicated day.

#### 3.1.6. Show Calendar
<br>
Format: `**show** PERIOD [to ENDDATE]`

This displays a calendar of the items within the timeframe entered. This is useful for seeing how busy you might be during a certain period which would allow to better plan your time.

<br>
> Parameter Usage:
> 
> **PERIOD**
> 
> The PERIOD parameter represents the time period of the calendar to be displayed.
> 
> Formats for displaying all items within a particular day: <br>
> >The PERIOD parameter follows the same format as the DATE parameter specified in 3.1.3. Add Deadline Task.
> 
> Formats for displaying all items within a particular week: <br>
> >The current week. 
> >
>     E.g. week represents the current week from the current day to the same day next week.
> 
> Formats for displaying all items within a particular month: <br>
> >1) The current month.
> >
>     E.g. month represents the current month from the current day to the end of the month.
> 
> > 2) A specific month spelt out in full

> >  The resulting period would be the coming indicated month. <br>
>  If the indicated month is the current month, the resulting period would be the same month next year. 
>>
>     E.g. August represents the coming August.
> 
> > 3) A specific month in its accepted abbreviated form as shown below
> > 
> 				January:	Jan
> 				February:	Feb
> 				March:		Mar
> 				April:		Apr
> 				May:		-
> 				June:		Jun
> 				July:		Jul
> 				August:		Aug
> 				September:	Sep or Sept
> 				October:	Oct
> 				November:	Nov
> 				December:	Dec
> 
> >The resulting period would be the coming indicated month.
> >
>     E.g. Sept represents the coming September.
> 
> > 4) MONTH YYYY format.
> > 
> The resulting period would be the indicated month of the specified year.
> Either the full form or the abbreviated form can be used for the month.
> 
> >  	E.g. Sept 2017 represents September of 2017

> **ENDDATE**
> 
> The ENDDATE parameter represents the ending period of the calendar to be displayed. It must be preceded by 'to'.
> 
> If ENDDATE is a specific day, the calendar will be shown until that day inclusive.
> 
> If ENDDATE is a specific month, the calendar will be shown until the end of that month. 
> 
> If PERIOD is a specific day, the calendar will be shown from that day inclusive.
> 
> If PERIOD is a specific month, the calendar will be shown from the start of that month.
> 
> If PERIOD is the current day, week or month, the calendar will start from the current day.

<br>
Examples:

`**show** week`

> This will show all your events within the current week.

`**show** 2512`

> This will show you all your events on December 25 of the current year.

<br>
#### 3.1.7. Complete a To-do or Deadline 
<br>
Format: `**complete** INDEX...`

This marks a To-do or Deadline of the specified index as completed and in so doing, deletes the item from **KeyboardWarrior**. This action is irreversible. This should be used for tasks that have been completed and do not need to be dealt with nor remembered anymore. You can complete To-dos and Deadlines but not Events.

A list of items must be displayed before using this command.
It is possible to mark multiple tasks as completed in a single command by entering more than one `INDEX`.

<br>
> Parameter Usage:
> 
> **INDEX**
> 
> The INDEX refers to the index number corresponding to the listed item shown on the calendar.
>
> The INDEX must be a letter followed by an integer, <br>
> E.g. D2, T2
