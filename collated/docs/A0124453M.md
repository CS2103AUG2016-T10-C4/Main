## 1. About

**KeyboardWarrior** is a scheduler and task manager application that accepts short and intuitive commands to provide a quick and convenient way to manage tasks using only the keyboard.

Our target audience are users who receives tasks that are to be scheduled at a later date. It allows the user to schedule, reschedule, update, and delete tasks with just a single command.

This guide describes the design and implementation of **KeyboardWarrior**. It will help you understand how **KeyboardWarrior** works and how you can further contribute to its development. We have organised this guide in a top-down manner so that you can understand the big picture before moving on to the more detailed sections.


## 2. Setting up

### 2.1. Before Using the Application

1. Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
   > Having any Java 8 version is not enough. <br>
   This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
   
2. Download the latest `KeyboardWarrior.jar` from the [releases](../../../releases) tab.

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your **KeyboardWarrior**.

### 2.2. Launching the Application

Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds. <br><br>

## 3. Architecture

<img src="images/Architecture.jpg" width="700"> <br>
> Figure 1: The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App. 

**KeyboardWarrior** is made up of four main components:

1. The **UI** component consists of JavaFX's FXML files which defines the layout that is displayed, and how you can interact with it through the CLI and the Java files that control these FXML files.
2. The **Backend** component contains all the logic needed to parse your commands and stores the collated data into individual files. etc.
3. The **Data** component represents the objects involved in the collation of source files such as the authors of the project and code snippets that were written.
4. The **Test** Driver component tests the UI, Backend and Data components. It utilises JUnit for unit testing.

The user can interact with **KeyboardWarrior** through the Command Line Interface (CLI). The actions initiated by the user are sent as commands by the UI to the Backend and Data component. The Backend component contains the Logic component which parses the command and then runs the corresponding action. The action executed would also go through Storage and into the Collated Files. A response would then be reflected to the user.

The sections below give an in depth explanation of each component.


## 4. UI Component

<img src="images/UI Component.jpg" width="700"> <br>
> Figure 2: Structure of the `UI` Component.

The UI consists of mainly â€œMainWindowâ€? and â€œGuiâ€?, along with other minor parts . The â€œMainWindowâ€? contains â€œoutputConsoleâ€?, â€œcommandInputâ€?, â€œdisplayResultâ€? etc. The â€œGuiâ€? contains the design for the graphic interface the user sees and handles the userâ€™s input and output display. All of these will be handled by the graphic display, text boxes and text displays. 

The UI component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layout of MainWindow is defined in matching â€œ.fxmlâ€? files that are located in â€œkeyboardwarrior/ui/ folderâ€?, for example â€œMainWindow.fxmlâ€?.

The UI component executes user commands using the â€œLogicâ€? component, making use of â€œFormatterâ€? when needed and responds to user actions by updating the UI accordingly.


## 5. Backend Component

<img src="images/Backend Component.jpg" width="700"> <br>
> Figure 3: Structure of the `Backend` Component.

The backend component contains the â€œLogicâ€? component and is the main processing unit of the program. It processes commands, data manipulation and data storage. 

â€œLogicâ€? uses the â€œParserâ€? class to parse the user inputs into â€œcommandsâ€? and â€œargumentsâ€?. This will create a â€œcommandâ€? object and will be executed with the appropriate â€œargumentsâ€?. The result of the execution will be encapsulated in a â€œCommandResultâ€? object which is passed back to the UI component. 


## 6. Data Component

<img src="images/Data Component.jpg" width="700"> <br>
> Figure 4: Structure of the `Data` Component.

The data component stores the **KeyboardWarrior** data in a class â€œTasksListâ€?. This class contains three types of individual tasks.

It exposes a read only class â€œReadOnlyTasksâ€? that can be shown to the users and does not allow any write capabilities. 


## 7. Storage Component

<img src="images/Storage Component.jpg" width="700"> <br>
> Figure 4: Structure of the `Storage` Component.

The storage component transfers the data from the Data component to a text file using xml format. The data stored in the file is able to be read back and transferred to the Data component. This allows **KeyboardWarrior** to have saving and loading functionalities.


## 8. Testing

**KeyboardWarrior** uses `JUnit` to perform unit tests on the `UI`, `Backend` and `Data` components. Every method is unit tested to ensure everything works as intended.

You can find the tests in the `./test/java/ruby/keyboardwarrior` folder.

We have two types of tests:

1. **Logic Tests** - {TODO: Add description}
  
2. **Parser Tests** - {TODO: Add description}
  
 
#### Troubleshooting tests
 **Problem: Tests fail because NullPointException when AssertionError is expected**
 * Reason: Assertions are not enabled for `JUnit` tests. 
   This can happen if you are not using a recent Eclipse version (i.e. _Neon_ or later)
 * Solution: Enable assertions in `JUnit` tests as described 
   [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2522897/eclipse-junit-ea-vm-option). <br>
   Delete run configurations created when you ran tests earlier.

<br>
#### 3.1.2. Add a To-do task
<br>
Format: `**add** TASK`

This adds a To-do to the schedule in **KeyboardWarrior**. A To-do is a kind of task that needs to be done by no specific deadline. It only contains a description of the task. 

It is useful for things that you might want to do in the near future but do not have a strict deadline for completion, e.g. reading a book for leisure.

<br>
> Parameter usage:
> 
> **TASK**
> 
> The TASK parameter should be the name or a short description of the To-do to be created.	

<br>
Examples: 

`**add** buy chocolate milk`

> Creates a new To-do with the description Ã¢â‚¬Å“Buy ChocolateÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.

<br>
#### 3.1.3. Add a Deadline task
<br>
Format: `**add** TASK by DATE [TIME]`

This adds a Deadline to the schedule in **KeyboardWarrior**. A Deadline is a kind of task that has to be completed by a specific deadline. Hence the date of the deadline should be specified in the command in addition to its description. A specific time here is optional.

This is suitable for most work-related tasks as they are usually scheduled within a certain timeframe to meet clientsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ demands, e.g. proposal submissions. 

<br> 
> Parameter usage:
> 
> **TASK**
> 
> The TASK parameter should be the name or a short description of the Deadline to be created.
>  
> **DATE**
> 
> The DATE parameter represents the specific day of the deadline.
> 
> Acceptable formats:
> 
> > 1) DDMMYY format.
> > 
>     E.g. 160417 represents the date April 16, 2017.
> 
> > 2) DDMM format.
> > 
> The year would be automatically set as the current year.
> 
> >     E.g. 0302 represents the date February 03 of the current year. 
> 
> > 3) Today.
> >
> The deadline would be set as the current day.
> 
> >		E.g. today represents the current day.
>

#### 3.1.6. Show Calendar
<br>
Format: `**show** PERIOD [to ENDDATE]`

This displays a calendar of the items within the timeframe entered. This is useful for seeing how busy you might be during a certain period which would allow to better plan your time.

<br>
> Parameter Usage:
> 
> **PERIOD**
> 
> The PERIOD parameter represents the time period of the calendar to be displayed.
>

> 
> Formats for displaying all items within a particular week: <br>
> >The current week. 
> >
>     E.g. week represents the current week from the current day to the same day next week.
> 
> Formats for displaying all items within a particular month: <br>
> >1) The current month.
> >
>     E.g. month represents the current month from the current day to the end of the month.
> 
> > 2) A specific month spelt out in full

> >  The resulting period would be the coming indicated month. <br>
>  If the indicated month is the current month, the resulting period would be the same month next year. 
>>
>     E.g. August represents the coming August.
>

> **ENDDATE**
> 
> The ENDDATE parameter represents the ending period of the calendar to be displayed. It must be preceded by 'to'.
> 
> If ENDDATE is a specific day, the calendar will be shown until that day inclusive.
> 
> If ENDDATE is a specific month, the calendar will be shown until the end of that month. 
> 
> If PERIOD is a specific day, the calendar will be shown from that day inclusive.
> 
> If PERIOD is a specific month, the calendar will be shown from the start of that month.
> 
> If PERIOD is the current day, week or month, the calendar will start from the current day.

<br>
Examples:

`**show** week`

> This will show all your events within the current week.

`**show** 2512`

> This will show you all your events on December 25 of the current year.

<br>
#### 3.1.7. Complete a To-do or Deadline 
<br>
Format: `**complete** INDEX...`

This marks a To-do or Deadline of the specified index as completed and in so doing, deletes the item from **KeyboardWarrior**. This action is irreversible. This should be used for tasks that have been completed and do not need to be dealt with nor remembered anymore. You can complete To-dos and Deadlines but not Events.

A list of items must be displayed before using this command.
It is possible to mark multiple tasks as completed in a single command by entering more than one `INDEX`.

<br>
> Parameter Usage:
> 
> **INDEX**
> 
> The INDEX refers to the index number corresponding to the listed item shown on the calendar.
>
> The INDEX must be a letter followed by an integer, <br>
> E.g. D2, T2
